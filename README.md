# 20-challenge
Challenge 20 for the Columbia FinTech Bootcamp

## Technologies
For this challenge, I used the Remix IDE to edit the `joint_savings.sol` file. I coded the challenge in the Solidity programming language.

## Assignment
First, I edited the provided file by defining variables and functions to create a joint savings account on the Ethereum blockchain. This allows one of two possible users to withdraw and deposit funds into the contract. 

In the second part of this assignment, I compiled and deployed my smart contract in the Remix VM environment. 

Finally, I interacted with my deployed smart contract and completed the following instructions.
